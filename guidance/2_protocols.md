Dear GLOMICON partners,

Below, please find some supporting guidance on how to provide your protocols in preparation for the cross-observatory analysis.

We will support this process and are happy to validate the protocol records and provide feedback.

Please let us know if you need any help or support. We would also be happy to offer a session in which we go through the standardisation of an example protocol together.

## Formatting
We are fortunate to be partnering up with the UN Ocean Decade Programme [OBON](https://www.obon-ocean.org) and its project [BeBOP](https://www.oceandecade.org/actions/better-biomolecular-ocean-practices/) for protocol management and sharing. Thus, we will be making use of the resources provided by the BeBOP team.

For protocol templates and guidance on how to use them, please see the [BeBOP Github repository](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template). If you are unable to edit the protocol templates in Markdown, please let us know and we will provide you with Google Doc templates of the protocols.

For examples of how the protocol templates are being used, please see the [collection of MBARI example protocols](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/mbari_protocol_collection).


## Hosting
All files will need permanent identifiers (PIDs). As noted in the BeBOP README, the protocols can be added to zenodo to receive PIDs and confirm long-term storage.

## Sharing
Once the protocols are safely stored in a long term and stable repository, please share the PIDs to the protocols in
- JSON-LD following the format as given in [LINK], with one JSON-LD per multi-fastq file
- a csv file which we will then put into the JSON-LD format
