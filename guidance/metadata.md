Dear GLOMICON partners, 

Below, please find some supporting guidance to help us get our metadata in order, in preparation for the overarching analysis and submission to the INSDC. 

For this project, we’d like a coherent set of metadata to facilitate comparative work and set an example for the wider community. To accomplish this we’ll be closely following the Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) standard. 

We will support this process and are happy to validate the metadata records and provide feedback.

## Understanding the MIxS checklist
Our metadata guidelines are based on the MIxS checklist. To support your work, we have prepared metadata tables for each partner organisation in which relevant fields for this sample exchange are highlighted and which contain examples appropriate to your work (please see here and use the file which has your institution’s name in the title). 

The metadata spreadsheet contains three tabs:
1. Tab 1: README
2. Tab 2: MIxS core  
3. Tab 3: environmental_packages

### Tab 1: README
The README provides general information on how the spreadsheets are organised, as well as some general guidance to approach and use the standard.

### Tab 2: MIxS core
This tab contains a table with names, definitions, syntax and unit specifications, and additional guidance on the core MIxS fields. 

### Tab 3: water environmental_packages
This tab contains a table with names, definitions and additional guidance from the MIxS environmental package **water**, which we will use to further describe the environment we sampled. 

--- 

In Tab 2 and 3, fields are highlighted in the following manner:
- Fields marked in blue are relevant for **Phase 1** and are mandatory or highly recommended based on our MIxS extension and our sample exchange
  - Phase 1 spans the sample collection up to sequence analysis 
- Fields marked in green are relevant for **Phase 2** and are mandatory or highly recommended based on our MIxS extension and our sample exchange
  - We will be entering Phase 2 when we are making our sequence data, protocols, etc. publicly available

Please also consider if any of the unmarked fields may be relevant to you. This may be especially important for the environmental package **_water_** as the amount of data recorded may vary between partners.

## Using the MIxS checklist

We’ve structured the spreadsheet for MIxS core and the MIxS environmental_package to have mandatory MIxS fields at the top, followed by the remaining fields. 

When entering entries in the sheets, please consider the following:

### Value syntax and units
**Please follow the value syntax** (given in tab MIxS, column E) **and the preferred unit** (if noted in MIxS, column S)

### Missing values
**If a value is missing, please follow the [INSDC missing value vocabulary](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/missing-values.html)**
- not applicable - information is inappropriate to report, can indicate that the standard itself fails to model or represent the information appropriately
- not collected - information of an expected format was not given because it has not been collected
- not provided - information of an expected format was not given, a value may be given at the later stage
- restricted access - information exists but can not be released openly because of privacy concerns

### Ontology terms (relevant only for MIxS core)
**Please be sure to use ontology terms wherever requested. **

Based on the information you have already shared, we have prepared lists of potentially relevant ontology terms (see below). 

Please let us know if none of these terms are applicable/you have done something else. [Here](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/ENVO-annotations-for-MIxS-v5) is also some dedicated guidance on using ENVO terms to fill in metadata. If you don’t find the term you are looking for in ENVO, please let us know and we’ll add them.

If you would like additional help browsing ontologies please contact us.
